# functionalStuff

### Purpose:

* Learn the very fundementals of javascript that are used to create and structure all modern JS libraries and frameworks.
* Hear lectures and workshops from industry leading experts such as Kyle Simpson, Douglas Crockford and others.
* See what is going on 'under the hood' of javascript engines.
* Use and understand the barebones DOM api's before jumping into big javascript frameworks.
* Learn functional programming concepts in javascript such as the use of this, closure, higher order functions, etc.

### Resources:

For the sake of learning, I will use the courses provided at https://frontendmasters.com. After comparing a few sites, I've come to
the conclusions that this is the best resource for the topics that I am interested in. 

### In this repo:

In this repo, I will keep copies of all the exercises that I will do during the learning process. For bigger projects covering
such things as building an app using a framework, I will create different repos. This repo will only cover parts concerning the
very fundementals of javascript and nothing more.
